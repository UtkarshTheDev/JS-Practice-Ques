# 🧠 JavaScript Daily Practice – One Question a Day

Welcome to my **JavaScript Question Series** – a personal journey where I solve one JavaScript problem every single day to improve consistency, problem-solving, and deep understanding of core concepts.

> 🔥 Goal: **1 commit/day** | 📆 Streak-friendly | 📚 Learn & Grow | 💻 100% JavaScript

---

## 📌 How This Works

Every day, I:
- ✅ Pick a **JavaScript question**
- ✅ Solve it with clean, commented code
- ✅ Commit it with the date and question title
- ✅ Optionally write a short explanation in a `.md` file

---

## 🗂️ Folder Structure

```
📁 questions/ ├── day-001-two-sum.js ├── day-002-palindrome-check.js ├── day-003-closure-example.js └── ... 📁 explanations/ ├── day-001.md ├── day-002.md └── ...
```

> ✨ Each file is named with the day number and question title for easy tracking.
