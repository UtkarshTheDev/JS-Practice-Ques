# 🧠 JavaScript Daily Questions – By Utkarsh

Welcome to my **JavaScript Daily Questions** repository!  
This folder contains my **daily solutions** to JavaScript coding problems, designed to keep my GitHub streak alive, sharpen problem-solving skills, and stay consistent in the dev game.

---

## 📅 Structure

Each day I solve one question and push it to this folder. The files are organized like this:

```
questions/ ├── day-01.js ├── day-02.js ├── day-03.js ...
```

Each file contains:
- 📌 The problem description (as a comment)
- 💡 My approach/thought process
- ✅ Final working solution

---

## 🚀 Purpose of This Repo

- 📈 Keep my GitHub streak alive
- 🧠 Improve logic-building using vanilla JavaScript
- ⏳ Maintain daily discipline and consistency
- 🛠️ Prepare for interviews / contests / personal growth

---

## 🔥 Example Format (`day-01.js`)

```js
// 🚀 Day 01 - Reverse a String
// Problem: Write a function to reverse a string.
// Input: "hello"
// Output: "olleh"

function reverseString(str) {
  return str.split('').reverse().join('');
}

console.log(reverseString("hello")); // olleh

```
